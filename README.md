### About Me

Hi, I’m **Dr. Ren**, an infectious disease and social epidemiologist with a passion for data, technology, and public health. My background includes a Master of Public Health and a Doctor of Public Health, and I currently serve as the Director of Public Health at a non-profit in Philadelphia. Outside of work, I enjoy coding, photography, and [writing](https://epiren.medium.com).

### Why?

Coding empowers me to bridge the gap between data and impactful solutions. Here, I combine my expertise in epidemiology with my love for technology to create projects that inspire, educate, and improve lives. Whether you're a fellow coder, a public health professional, or someone curious about the intersection of health and technology, there's something here for you.
