Local farmers say dozens of flying foxes—fruit bats—have been dropping from the trees, twitching and dead.

This isn’t just unusual... it's unsettling. In this region, bats are sacred to some and a pest to others. But to an epi like you, they’re a potential reservoir. You make a note, forward the report, and set an alert for regional syndromic surveillance updates.

The ER nurse says they're not like dengue cases, and their pupils are slow to respond.

You pull up their records: all five are from families who process pig feed or harvest mangoes from the orchard. One had a family member report seeing bats drinking from sap collection pots. One child fed a sick bat. The hospital doesn’t have isolation.

Families are in and out of the rooms. Nurses are unmasked. A wedding is scheduled for that village this weekend. Hundreds will gather. You feel the hairs rise on your neck. This could be a zoonotic spillover.`,

We’re also seeing viral inclusion bodies under the scope. Maybe paramyxoviruses.'

You nod grimly. In your line of work, Nipah virus always lurks in the background. Transmitted by bats. Amplified in pigs. Fatal in humans. And if it evolves enough, maybe even airborne someday.

Through whispered stories, you piece together what may be the key: a child fed a dying bat. A family boiled sap gathered from trees visited by bats.

This is the transmission path—bat to sap to people. Pig as amplifier. It’s textbook Nipah, but this version seems faster.

Your notebook fills with dates, names, symptoms. You hear coughing from a neighbor’s hut.

If you're right, a ring of early exposures has already spread out in all directions. You may be walking through the first ring of a much wider fire.`,
